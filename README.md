Influential node identification project

### What is this repository for?
Log book and data repository for influential node analysis.

#### What is an influential node analysis?
With this analysis we are aiming at identifying a subset of nodes of a model who's activity is relevant for it's predictions.
This can then be use to identify nodes who's activity should preferably be measured and used to calibrate the model.
